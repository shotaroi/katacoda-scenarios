# Setup a Gradle project

Let's make a folder where we can create our code with cucumber testing:

`mkdir cucumber-project`{{execute}}

And enter the new folder:

`cd cucumber-project`{{execute}}

In order to use Cucumber testing, you have to use a build tool, either Gradle or Maven. This tutorial uses Gradle. Let's start setting up a Gradle. We do this by running the following command:

`gradle init`{{execute}}

You have to chose some alternatives:
`1`{{execute}}
`1`{{execute}}
`\r\n`{{execute}}

Great! Gradle is now configured in the folder. You can verify this by doing `ls`{{execute}}, and you will see new gradle files in the directory.
